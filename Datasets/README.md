# Dataset Transformations
 This directory is a space to keep your original dataset(s). The goal is to start with your original dataset, in whatever format you have it in, and create a transformation script that gets it into the _WI Batch Upload Template_ format.
 create the new batch upload files here as well. 

# The typical directory structure can be:
 ProjectName
  - Original Data Files Directory Name
	- one or more files	
  - Batch Upload Files Directory Name 
     	- The four files required for batch upload:
		- projects.csv
		- cameras.csv
		- deployments.csv
		- images.csv
