# Example Data Transformation Script
A dataset from Peru is provided as an example dataset that needs to be transformed into the WI batch upload templates.  

The ```Cafe_Fauna``` is a project level directory that contains the original dataset.  
The file ```species_mapping_template.csv``` is the species lookup table that was created to map the taxonomy used in the Cafe Fauna project into the Wildlife Insights Global Taxonomy. You will need to create one of these for your project. This must include a record for _every single scientific or common name_ you use in your dataset.
